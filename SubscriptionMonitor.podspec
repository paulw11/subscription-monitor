  s.description      = <<-DESC
SubscriptionMonitor automates the tasks required to validate in-app purchase receipts for auto-renewing subscriptions.
It will periodically refresh the application receipt and validate it against your server.  It will then deliver an NSNotification (and optionally invoke a closure) to let your app know that the receipt has been refreshed and that it should check for changes in subscriptions.
